# realtime-event-labeling-tool
This tool enables realtime recording of events and associated timestamps.

---

**Usage**\
In order to use this tool, run the Java program TimeStamp.java. Whenever the user wants to record a new event (along with its timestamp) simply type whatever letter (*must be a single letter*) you choose to correspond to that event. Once you are done, simply type ``e`` to exit, and a list of all your notes along with their timestamps will be printed.
